			<h1>F.A.Q.</h1>
			<hr>
			<p class="lead">What is this?</p>
			<p>Well, I noticed that on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace" target="_blank">/r/pcmasterrace</a> there were lots of giveaways of Steam keys. However, they worked solely on a basis of first-come-first-serve, and there was always a chance of the key being sniped by a bot. So, I made this site.</p>
			<hr>
			<p class="lead">How does it work?</p>
			<p>
				Here's how a giveaway works here:<br>
				<ol>
					<li>The person who wants to give away a key creates a new giveaway.</li>
					<li>The giver gets a public URL to post on reddit, or wherever they want to do the giveaway.</li>
					<li>When someone visits the URL, they are met with a CAPTCHA. When they fill out the CAPTCHA correctly, they have a 1/100 chance (or any chance set by the giveaway creator) of getting the key.</li>
					<li>People continue visiting the URL and filling out the CAPTCHA in hopes of getting the key. When someone finally does, they are prompted for a thank you message, and can optionally supply their reddit username. This information is then displayed on the now-closed giveaway page</li>
					<li>The giver feels warm and fuzzy, and some lucky person enjoys a new game</li>
				</ol>

			<p class="lead">How can I trust you? How do I know you won't just steal my games?</p>
			<p>First of all, my <a href="http://reddit.com/u/Jaxkr" target="_blank">reddit account</a> is 3 years old, and my <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaxkr/" target="_blank">Steam account</a> is over 9 years old. I don't want to risk this repuation for some silly game keys.<br>Plus, as you can see from my Steam profile, I already own over 60 games, but all I play is Dota 2, which is F2P. I don't need more games.</p>
